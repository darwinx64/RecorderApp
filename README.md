# DO NOT USE THIS
I feel like I don't need to point this out. Do not use it. This is the first time I have EVER used python or even ffmpeg for that matter. I was incredibly ambitious. It uses tkinter and is absolutely horrid.

I made it in a single day trying to make a simple quick user friendly alternative to OBS. I think the idea is pretty fun- and it was pretty fun to work on, so I may try this again at some point.

## Dependencies
[Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/)

[FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)

ffmpeg needs to be added to path or be in the working directory

## Running
```sh
cd RecorderApp
python3 main.py
```
